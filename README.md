# Student Performance Analysis ðŸ“Š

## 1. Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of student academic performance based on various demographic and preparatory factors. The primary goal is to identify key indicators that influence student scores in math, reading, and writing. A predictive model is also built using Linear Regression to forecast math scores based on randomly generated study hours.

## 4. How to Run This Project
1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Execute the Python script:
    ```bash
    python Student_performance_analysis.py
    ```
The script will print dataset information to the console and generate several visualizations.

## 5. Key Findings
* **Test Preparation is Key:** Students who completed the test preparation course consistently scored higher across all subjects. This was the most significant indicator of improved performance.
* **Parental Education Matters:** There is a positive correlation between the parental level of education and student scores, with students of parents holding higher degrees performing better on average.
* **Predictive Model:** The linear regression model demonstrated a positive correlation between study hours and math scores, confirming that more study time can lead to better performance.
